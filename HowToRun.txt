Ensure that you have the following installed:
Install Python 3.8.2
Install postgreSQL & pgAdmin

Go to Command Prompt/Shell:
pip install pipenv //Need a pipenv to generate piplock file (if not generated)
pipenv shell //Start pipenv (virtual env) for python so that the modules are not installed globally
pipenv install flask
pipenv install psycopg2
pipenv install psycopg2-binary
pipenv install flask-sqlalchemy
pipenv install gunicorn (Not sure if needed yet) //for Heroku/Server, but not required unless we want to store the database somewhere

In foodsanta, there is a settings.py file. Edit this file to your settings (since we using diff password)

To setup database, you need to create database called foodsanta and connect to it via psql

--FOR TESTING--
To test if the database is working, run \i testsetup.sql in psql and start the web application with python app.py in Terminal/Command Prompt

So there's a form to put member name and rice purity score. If you add in a member that is already existing (case-sensitive), it will refresh the page 

If you add in a member that's not within the Test table, it will render a success page. You can view if the member/score has been added by refreshing pgAdmin and checking.

Do note that you need to refresh the browser and not the table.

--FOR SETUP OF FOODSANTA--
Run \i init.sql in psql

If successful, you should see the tables being created under the database.

In order to start the web application, run python app.py in Terminal/Command Prompt

--TO CHECK--

Ensure your pip file looks like this: (pylint is optional, only if you are using VSC)
